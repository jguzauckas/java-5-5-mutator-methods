# Basics Check

In the `Student.java` file, complete accessor methods for all instance variables. Ensure that the `gradeLevel` cannot be set to above `12` or below `1`.

When done correctly, the `TestStudent.java` file should no longer have any errors and produces the following output when run:

```
John
Guzauckas
123456

Jack
